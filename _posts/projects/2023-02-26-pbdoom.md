PBDoom is a port of the Doom (1993) videogame for PocketBook eInk devices. Downloads
are on [the official website of PBDoom][pbdoom].

PBDoom is based on [Sam Lantinga's SDL Doom][sdl-doom]. SDL drawing functions
were replaced with PocketBook SDK's `inkview` library functions. SDL sound functions
were completely removed from the code for now (not many PocketBooks have speakers nowadays,
headphones usually can be connected however).

The development of PBDoom started in March of 2022. The first public release
was published in January of 2023.

Source code is [available on GitHub][pbdoom-github].

## Why?
This project serves several purposes:
1. Produce an example of an action game on an eInk reader device
2. One more custom application for PocketBook
3. Gather experience of using the `inkview` library

Porting Doom was not a big project. SDL Doom runs on Linux and (some) PocketBooks
run Linux. Reworking the main graphics output function to use `inkview`'s `FillArea`
(fill a rectangle with a color) function instead of writing pixel data
to an SDL surface is easy.

However, due to some limitations of the eInk technology (low refresh rate,
lack of color on some devices) some additional work needs to be done on the
video output part. In this project we explore what needs to be done and what is possible.

Also this project has introduced me to [CMake][cmake].

## Can PocketBook run Doom?
Yes it can but this is not big news. The developers working on PocketBook
released a video of Doom running on a PocketBook 360 Plus back in 2011.

This version was produced "during a lunch break" ([original message][ebook-forum],
[archived message][ebook-forum-archive]) and was (to my knowledge) released to the public.

So, PBDoom can finally close the gap and serve as a publicly available Doom
for PocketBook.

## Image dithering: optimization for eInk
As noted before, eInk displays have low refresh rate. This requires some workarounds.

eInk displays's update time depends on the type of update needed. For example,
replacing a full-white region with a full-black region is faster than
working with shades of grey.

Using this quality, we can increase the refresh rate while sacrificing some
of the image quality.

The `inkview` library provides several functions to dither screen output
(`DitherArea` and others).

We also can manipulate the colors to improve brightness, contrast and do
gamma correction to fine tune the output.
