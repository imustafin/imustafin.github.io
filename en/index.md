# Hello!

My name is Ilgiz and I am a Software Engineer.

I worked on a number of projects ranging from Android applications to social network and business network
analysis tools.

Also, I do scientific research on the topic of Multilingual Entity Resolution.

I speak English, Russian, Tatar and some Turkish, now learning Romanian.
